Features
Real-time FPS calculation and display.
Transparent overlay that appears on top of your applications.
Simple and lightweight.

The FPS overlay will appear on your screen, showing the FPS in the top-left corner.

To close the overlay, simply close the window or press Ctrl + C in the terminal.

Customization
You can customize the position, font, or color of the FPS display by modifying the script. Look for the following parts of the code:
